A tiny collection of chaotic, clever, and low-pressure code experiments by a girl who decided to stop waiting for perfection and just **start building**.  
Every file in here is a vibe — not a final product, just ✨progress✨.

## 🌟 Why This Exists

I started this repo to:
- Overcome my perfectionist fears 😵‍💫
- Practice Python without pressure 🐍
- To learn with real-world useful mini exercises
- Turn tiny sparks of inspiration into code 🔥
- Keep it real, useful, and sometimes just fun ✨

## ⚠️ Warning
Some of this code is just for fun and progress. Don’t expect enterprise-grade Python — this is heart-coded 💘 not hardcore.

## 💡 What's Next?
- More learning mini projects will be posted here
- This is just a safe space for creativity and learning progress.
